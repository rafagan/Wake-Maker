Wake Maker for iOS
=========

Wake Maker is a prototype of an alarm clock with gamefication, made in one week in the Brazilian Education Program for iOS Development (BEPiD), at PUCPR, when we (Ráfagan Abreu and André Traleski Campos) decided to work together in the first BEPiD challenge.

The app is integrated with local iOS music library, and the user need to solve a mini game to stop the alarm song.
Run in iOS 8 or above.

We really want to work together again in this project, soon...

Last revision in December, 2014.
